# OkVoiture

This project is a full-stack application that uses Next.js and Nest.js on the frontend and backend, respectively, and Postgres as the backend database. The application allows individuals to share their cars with others by listing their vehicles and connecting with renters. The frontend is built with Next.js, which provides server-side rendering and fast page loads for a smooth user experience. The backend is built with Nest.js, a powerful Node.js framework that enables efficient API development and modular code organization. The database is built using Postgres, a robust and scalable relational database that provides reliable data storage and retrieval. 
The codebase follows best practices for clean code and architecture, and is well-documented for ease of use and future development. This project demonstrates the power of Next.js, Nest.js, and Postgres for building scalable and reliable full-stack applications.
